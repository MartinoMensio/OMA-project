# OMA-project
Optimization Methods and Algorithms project @ Polytechnic University of Turin

The purpose of the project was to extend the functionalities of an existing library (jsprit https://github.com/graphhopper/jsprit), able to solve VRPTW, in order to consider additional constraints in terms of the fleet size.
The fleet size can be set in order to use all the vehicles that a company may have, and the implementation uses some strategies to balance the work among the vehicles.

Members of the team:
- Francesco Maggiolino
- Giacomo Gustavino
- Martino Mensio
- Ovidiu Birgu
- Sabrina Camurati
- Tommaso Pifferi
